Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This project is aimed for people interested in health and fitness lifestyle. Provide a simple way to find popular and usefull information about 
fitness products, training music and workout videos.

Sales pitch: "All you need in one place".

-----------------------------------------
UX
-----------------------------------------

My goal to this project was to create a handy website for the users so they can find what they need in the same place.
Images, videos, links to spotify music, a contact form for opinions and my social links
are provided to produce a good user experience. Also, the media queries for all the devices (vertical and horizontal screen) were includedto ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
Color palette: Grey, dark red, turquoise.

Technologies
-----------------------------------------

1.HTML5
2.CSS3
3.Bootstrap 3.3.7


Features
-----------------------------------------
The site use a scrolling page so users can have an ease access and navegation. 
The navbar collapse in small devices so the design keep simple and organized.

Features left to Implement

In the future I would like add horizontal galleries to offer more products, videos and music albums. 

Testing
-----------------------------------------
The users can read an overview of the offered products and acces to the official seller page by clicking on the buy button. 
They are able to watch and listen the trainning videos and the spotify albums inside the website.
They are also able to view my social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the home page. 

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"'.
All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.

The navbar is fixed so the user can navigate ease through the sections.

This site was tested in Chrome, FireFox, Microsoft Edege and on multiple mobile devices in <a href:"http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdreeaml.github.io">Responsinator</a>.
